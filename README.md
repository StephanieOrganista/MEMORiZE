## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I would have to say that most of the challenges that I encountered in creating this project was in working with the Javascript file. I am able to compare the syntax to other programming languages, which helps a lot, but I do realize that I do lack some knowledge with the logic behind some of the Javascript. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am very familiar with the HTML and CSS part of front-end, but am currently improving my Javascript skills to be able to have a website perform actual functions. Therefore, most of my questions would be about working on the Javascript part of a website. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would work more on creating more functions to implement new features such as the optional ones stated above.
